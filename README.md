# Gemfinder

TODO: Write a gem description

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'gemfinder'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gemfinder

## Usage

If you want information about a gem, type in "gemfind [GEM NAME]" and you will see the name, version number, description, and URI of that gem. If you want to search for all of the gems with a certain sequence of letters in their name, type in "gem_explore [sequence of letters] to get all of those gems along with their names, version numbers, descriptions, and URIs. This is a great way to learn about a popular gem and all of the corollary gems that extend it or make it easier to use."
